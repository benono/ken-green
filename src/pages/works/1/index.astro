              Ken Green's 1931 Ford highboy roadster represents the pinnacle of
              his hot rod building journey. Built entirely by Ken in his home
              garage over 8 years, this vehicle showcases his exceptional skills
              as both designer and craftsman. As a trained draftsman, Ken
              personally designed, cast, and machined many unique features,
              including custom air cleaners, steering wheel, hub caps, and a
              Wally's Burger rear license plate frameâ€”a nod to where his passion
              for hot rods began. This home-built masterpiece earned a spot
              among just 11 contenders in the prestigious America's Most
              Beautiful Roadster competition at the Grand National Roadster
              Show. Competing against professionally-built vehicles, Ken's
              roadster impressed judges, earning runner-up status along with
              "Most Outstanding Detail" and "AMBR Achievement Award" honors.
