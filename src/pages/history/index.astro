              Ken Green is an accomplished hot rod builder whose passion for
              custom cars has spanned over six decades. At 79 years old, he
              recently achieved international recognition when his 1931 Ford
              highboy roadster was selected as one of just 11 contenders in the
              prestigious America's Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) competition
              at the 75th Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, California.
              Though he didn't win the top prize, his roadster earned runner-up
              status and won awards for "Most Outstanding Detail" and an "AMBR
              Achievement Award" - remarkable distinctions considering his was
              the only home-built roadster in the competition.

          Early Years & Inspiration
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Ken's fascination with hot rods began in his early teens in 1950s
          Vancouver. He would spend hours sitting on a bench outside Wally's
          Burgers on Kingsway, watching custom cars cruise by during the era of
          19-cent hamburgers. Alongside his brothers Rick and Cliff, Ken learned
          mechanical skills from their stationary engineer father and their
          grandfather, who owned Carleton Cycles. After school, the brothers
          would help fix bikes and lawn mowers, developing the technical
          foundation that would serve Ken throughout his life.

              The Green brothers eventually took over Carleton Cycles,
              transforming it into a Vancouver icon. Ken, a trained construction
              draftsman, designed the store's distinctive timber-framed
              chalet-style facade, using logs from his uncle's logging operation
              in Pemberton. The business evolved over the years - from building
              Talbot racing bicycles with their own racing team, to selling
              sporting equipment, and finally becoming Carleton Rescue
              Equipment, providing safety gear for search and rescue, police,
              fire, ambulance, and oilpatch workers. Throughout their 40 years
              in business together, the brothers continued building hot rods in
              their spare time.

          Ken is well-known for his 1946 Morris 8 mini hot rod, a masterpiece
          powered by a supercharged Ford V6 engine. This project, which he
          initially expected would take three years, stretched to 10 years and
          "10 times the money" as he perfected every detail. Ken has driven his
          "mighty mite" over 55,000 kilometers on rod run cruises throughout
          Western Canada and the U.S. with his group, the CanAm Curmudgeons,
          whose amusing motto is "Celebrating cross-border bitching and
          bullshitting." His current claim to fame, the 1931 Model A roadster,
          was built over 8Â½ years in his Burnaby home garage. As a skilled
          designer and craftsman, Ken drew, cast, and machined many unique
          features for this vehicle, including custom air cleaners, steering
          wheel, hub caps, and even a Wally's Burger rear license plate frame -
          a nod to where his passion for hot rods first began.

          Craftsmanship & Philosophy

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          What distinguishes Ken's work is his hands-on approach and dedication
          to craftsmanship. Unlike many builders who rely heavily on purchased
          parts, Ken creates many components himself. His attention to detail
          and commitment to quality craftsmanship earned his Model A roadster
          international recognition, despite competing against
          professionally-built vehicles.

          Coastal Swap Meet, which began in 1969 and continues to bring together
          car enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade parts.

              might be perfect for his next build. His journey from a young boy

              with excellence.
